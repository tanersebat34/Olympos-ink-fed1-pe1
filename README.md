About the Project

Olympos Ink is a website project designed for a professional tattoo studio. The aim of this project is to provide a platform where clients can explore the tattoo artist’s work, read blog posts, and book appointments. The website features a sleek and user-friendly interface, built with modern web technologies.

Features

	•	Homepage: A brief introduction to Olympos Ink and a showcase of the studio’s highlighted tattoo work.
	•	Video Section: A promotional video showing tattoo procedures at the studio.
	•	Carousel: A slider showcasing the top three tattoo works.
	•	Blog Section: A section for displaying the studio’s blog posts about their tattoo creations.
	•	Social Media Links: Links that direct users to social media platforms.

Project Setup

git clone https://github.com/tanersebat34/Olympos-ink-fed1-pe1.git
cd Olympos-ink-fed1-pe1

Since the project consists of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, you can directly open the index.html file in your browser to run it.

Technologies Used

	•	HTML5: For the structure and content of the pages.
	•	CSS3: For styling and layout.
	•	JavaScript (ES6+): For dynamic content loading and interactions like the carousel.
	•	Google Fonts: For custom web font usage.
	•	FontAwesome: For social media icons and other icons.

Usage

Once you run the project in your browser:

	•	Homepage: Offers an overview of the Olympos Ink tattoo studio.
	•	Carousel: Allows you to view the top tattoo works.
	•	Blog: Displays posts about the studio’s tattoo creations.
	•	Social Media: Provides links to the studio’s social media accounts for more information.


 JavaScript Functionality

	•	Login Functionality:
The JavaScript files include logic for handling user authentication through a login system. This allows users to access the administrative features, such as managing blogs or other content in the tattoo studio’s website.
	•	API Integration:
The project dynamically pulls content from an API to display blog posts, recent tattoo creations, and other information directly on the website. This allows for real-time updates without needing to modify the HTML manually.
The scripts in the /js folder handle fetching and rendering data from the API, ensuring that the content is always up-to-date.

These functionalities are vital for keeping the website interactive and user-friendly, especially for both administrators and regular visitors.

This section helps explain the role of JavaScript in your project and how it contributes to the functionality of your website.
